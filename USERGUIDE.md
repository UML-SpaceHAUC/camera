# UCAM-III by 4dsystems
## User Guide
### Introduction
This code was produced by UMass Lowell undergraduate Sean Cummings,
with assistance from fellow undergrads Dave Baumann and Joshua Hassler
as part of the SPACEHAUC Cubesat project at the university. For more information,
follow the link below:

The code was structured after the routines and commands in the datasheet,
found at the following link:

https://www.4dsystems.com.au/productpages/uCAM-III/downloads/uCAM-III_datasheet_R_1_0.pdf

The Python functions are fully implemented for the camera, with all commands represented.
Only 4 C commands are implemented: Sync, Initialize, Set Package Size, and Get Picture.
More may be implemented in the future.
