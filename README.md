# This repository contains Python and C code which allows users to
# take pictures with the UCAM-III camera. This code is part of the
# UMASS Lowell SpaceHAUC project, and is free to be used by anybody.

# Most instructions are found in the code files themselves. Currently,
# the jpeg.py file is set up to take a 640x480 JPEG and save it to a file
#called test.jpg. The test.py file takes a RAW photo and saves it as test.RAW.
#The test.c file tests syncing to the camera. The main.c file takes a 640x480 JPEG
#and saves it to a file named based off user input. All settings for the camera arer
#currently hardcoded.
